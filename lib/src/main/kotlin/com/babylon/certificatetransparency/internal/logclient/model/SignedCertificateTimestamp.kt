/**
 * A signed certificate timestamp. If the [sctVersion] is not [Version.V1], then a v1 client may be unable to verify the signature.
 *
 * @property sctVersion The version of the [SignedCertificateTimestamp] structure, in decimal.  A compliant v1 implementation MUST NOT expect
 * this to be 0 (i.e., [Version.V1]).
 * @property id The log ID, base64 encoded.  Since log clients who request an SCT for inclusion in TLS handshakes are not required to verify
 * it, we do not assume they know the ID of the log.
 * @property timestamp The SCT timestamp, in decimal. UTC time in milliseconds, since January 1, 1970, 00:00.
 * @property signature The SCT signature, base64 encoded.
 * @property extensions An opaque type for future expansion.  It is likely that not all participants will need to understand data in this
 * field.  Logs should set this to the empty string.  Clients should decode the base64-encoded data and include it in the SCT.
