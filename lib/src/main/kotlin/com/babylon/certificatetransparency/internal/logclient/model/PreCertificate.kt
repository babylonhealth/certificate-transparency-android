/**
 * @property issuerKeyHash [issuerKeyHash] is the SHA-256 hash of the certificate issuer's public key, calculated over the DER encoding of the
 * key represented as [SubjectPublicKeyInfo].  This is needed to bind the issuer to the final certificate.
 * @property tbsCertificate [tbsCertificate] is the DER-encoded TBSCertificate (see [RFC5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)) component of
 * the Precertificate -- that is, without the signature and the poison extension.  If the Precertificate is not signed with the CA certificate
 * that will issue the final certificate, then the TBSCertificate also has its issuer changed to that of the CA that will issue the final
 * certificate.  Note that it is also possible to reconstruct this TBSCertificate from the final certificate by extracting the TBSCertificate
 * from it and deleting the SCT extension. Also note that since the TBSCertificate contains an AlgorithmIdentifier that must match both the
 * Precertificate signature algorithm and final certificate signature algorithm, they must be signed with the same algorithm and parameters.  If
 * the Precertificate is issued using a Precertificate Signing Certificate and an Authority Key Identifier extension is present in the
 * TBSCertificate, the corresponding extension must also be present in the Precertificate Signing Certificate -- in this case, the
 * TBSCertificate also has its Authority Key Identifier changed to match the final issuer.
